# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent - SUPER_ADMIN only access, zero PII exposure verified by test, proper JWT validation, SQL injection protection via parameterized queries"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent - efficient database aggregation, 365-day limit prevents abuse, client-side CSV export (instant), async queries, proper indexing"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent - comprehensive input validation, proper error handling, graceful degradation, loading states, error messages"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent - clean architecture, type safety (Pydantic + TypeScript), well-documented, modular components, comprehensive tests"

# Performance Benchmarks
performance_notes: |
  Expected performance based on implementation analysis:
  - Date ranges with <10K sessions: <100ms
  - Date ranges with <100K sessions: <500ms
  - Maximum range (365 days): <2s
  - CSV export: <1s (client-side, instant)
  - All queries use database-level aggregation (optimal)
  - Proper indexes leveraged (started_at, category, mode)

# Architecture Highlights
architecture_strengths:
  - "Single endpoint with comprehensive aggregation reduces API complexity"
  - "Pydantic models ensure response type safety"
  - "SQLAlchemy aggregation prevents N+1 query problems"
  - "Client-side CSV generation distributes load"
  - "Recharts library provides professional visualizations"
  - "Clean separation of concerns (API, state, UI)"

# Security Audit
security_audit:
  pii_protection: " Verified - no user IDs, room names, or transcripts in responses"
  access_control: " Verified - SUPER_ADMIN only, proper 403/401 responses"
  input_validation: " Verified - date format, range limits, logical constraints"
  sql_injection: " Protected - SQLAlchemy parameterized queries"
  rate_limiting: " Not implemented (acceptable for MVP, monitor post-launch)"
